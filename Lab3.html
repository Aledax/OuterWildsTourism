                    <h2>Overview</h2>
                    <p>
                        New to exploring the solar system and want to get your feet wet? Brittle
                        Hollow never fails to impress, with sprawling Nomai cities and relics elegantly
                        arranged just beneath its crust.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Hollow's Black Hole</h2>
                    <p>
                        If you slip and fall into the central black hole, don't despair - 
                        you'll be safely teleported to the White Hole Station, a Nomai structure located near the edge of our
                        solar system. A warp pad inside takes you back to Brittle Hollow just as quickly as you left.
                        We have yet to understand the mechanism behind this warp technology.
                    </p>

            <h1>Essential Travel Safety</h1>
            <hr>

            <!-- Content -->
            <p class="topmost">
                Our solar system is home to some very beautiful and very dangerous planets.
                No one plans on dying on recreational interplanetary trips, but it
                can and does happen. Remember that your Spaceship contains limited oxygen,
                fuel, and medical supplies. Always be aware of your suit's ghost matter
                sensor.
            </p>
            <p>
                Here are specific things to be aware of on each planet in our solar system:
            </p>
            <h2>Timber Hearth</h2>
            <p>
                Mostly safe. On Geyser Mountains, do not attempt to enter the geysers.
            </p>
            <h2>Brittle Hollow</h2>
            <p>
                Staying on the surface may result in being burnt to a crisp by a fiery present
                from Brittle Hollow's volcanic moon, Hollow's Lantern. The probability of collision is low, but stay aware.
            </p>
            <h2>Giant's Deep</h2>
            <p>
                When the tornadoes sweep the island you're on into space, stay grounded
                as you fall back to prevent flattening your entire body upon landing. It would also be
                wise to not get sucked into a tornado yourself.
            </p>
            <h2>Ash Twin</h2>
            <p>
                The flowing sand column between Ash Twin and Ember Twin will not hurt you directly,
                but it may send you (or your ship) flying off into space. Unfortunately,
                most of Ash Twin's landmarks lie directly on the column's path, so don't get too caught up
                admiring the architecture.
            </p>
            <h2>Ember Twin</h2>
            <p>
                When sand is flowing from Ash Twin to Ember Twin, the floor rises
                quickly, so don't linger underground. Anyone who finds themselves trapped in a cave
                underground will be crushed effortlessly. Try not to hug cacti.
            </p>
            <h2>Dark Bramble</h2>
            <p>
                We advise you to avoid this location entirely.
            </p>
